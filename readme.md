# Overview

TODO list application written in C++.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}

This is a simple comand line application that allows you to add tasks to a list, print out the list, and mark indiviual tasks as complete. The list is saved to a file and loaded when the application is started.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the basic syntax of C++. The project uses strings, boolean values, and a custom find function to search for tasks in the list.

# Development Environment

To develop this project, I used Visual Studio Code with the C++ extension. I used the MinGW compiler to compile the code.

I used C++ to write this project. I used the standard library to work with strings and boolean values. Additionally, I used the fstream library to read and write to a file.

# Future Work

- Build a UI
- Allow users to set the file name
- add save and load functions (no longer save and load by default)
